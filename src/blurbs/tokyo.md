Tokyo station, with its domes and red-brick facade, is an architectural anachronism amid the skyscrapers of the Marunouchi business district. The station stands at the center of several major attractions: the Imperial Palace to the west, Nihonbashi bridge to the north, Tsukiji fish market to the east, and the Ginza to the south. It is also one of only two station in the city to offer Shinkansen service.
