Komagome's departure melody is the folk-song *Sakura Sakura*, which is a nod to Komagome's status as the birthplace of the Somei-Yoshino variety of cherry tree, by far the most popular variety in all of Japan. In the late Edo period, gardeners in the village of Somei-mura (preset-day Komagome) cultivated the Somei-Yoshino from wild cherry trees. The transient beauty of the tree's blossoms awed the Japanese people, who subsequently spread the tree across the entire country. Or so the story goes.
