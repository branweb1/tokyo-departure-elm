Most westerners recognize this departure melody as the theme from the 1949 film *The Third Man*. However, the melody's connection to Ebisu station comes not from film but from beer--Yebisu beer, to be precise, which was once brewed in this neighborhood and which has a long-running ad campaign featuring the tune. The Yebisu brewery moved to Chiba in the late 1980s. Present-day Ebisu is an upscale neighborhood known for its fine-dining establishments. But the departure melody at Ebisu station serves as a reminder of the neighborhood's blue-collar roots.
