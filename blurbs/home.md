><span class="entry">ekimelo</span> /ɛ-ki-mɛ-ləʊ/ *n*. A short song played at train stations around Tokyo, usually to signal a train's imminent departure [*origin:* a portmanteau word composed of *eki*, the Japanese word for "station", and *melo*, a truncation of the word "melody"]

This site is a collection of ekimelo. Ekimelo were introduced in the 1980s as a means of putting passengers at ease in a way that a bell or an alarm could not. They were meant to say to the passenger: "You've made your train. Everything is ok. Now relax and enjoy the ride." 

This site organizes ekimelo primarily by station. You will find a list of stations to the left. The station list is not exhaustive: many stations share the same melody, so where this is the case, only one was included on the list as a kind of representative and all the others sharing the same melody were omitted.

Oftentimes a melody has some connection to its station or to the neighborhood in which its station is located. Where this is the case, the connection is explained on the page for that particular station. If you find inaccuracies in or wish to add something to an explanation, please email me at <a href="mailto:branwebdev@icloud.com">branwebdev@icloud.com</a>.

There are some melodies not associated with a particular station. You will find these in the [orphaned melodies section](/#/orphaned). There are also miscellaneous station sounds that are not properly ekimelo but are interesting for one reason or another. They are collected [here](/#/sounds).
