Akihabara, the epicenter of otaku culture, began as an assemblage of radio-shops grouped around the local train station. These shops developed into Tokyo's "electrictown", a rabbit's warren of stalls selling an almost unimaginable variety of wires, bulbs, transistors, and other electronic parphernalia. Perhaps unsurpisingly, many of the electronics hobbyists who frequented electrictown also had other geeky interests, and in the 1990s, shops began to open that catered to these interests. Thus was born the Akihabara we know today, full of anime, maid cafes, and j-pop idols.
