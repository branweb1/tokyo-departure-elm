Situated between Shinjuku and Shibuya, Yoyogi is home to the Meiji shrine and Yoyogi park. On Sunday afternoons, at the Harajuku entrance to the park, [neo-Rockabilly gangs](http://www.messynessychic.com/2015/01/07/the-tokyo-subculture-of-1950s-rockabilly-gangs/) gather to dance to 1950s rock 'n' roll standards.
