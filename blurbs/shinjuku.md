Shinjuku has the busiest train station in Tokyo and by extension the world. Just west of the station is the "skyscraper district", home to both the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building (famous for its views of Tokyo) and the Park Hyatt hotel (the primary filming location of *Lost in Translation*). To the east is Golden Gai, an intricate network of narrow alleyways filled with tiny bars reminiscent of old Tokyo in the 1960s.
